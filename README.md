# CompBioGroupProject
This is my code for the independent project for Anna Ritz's Computational Systems Biology course in the Fall of 2019. The goal of this project was to use the protein-protein interaction network for *D. melanogaster* to predict novel regulators of non-muscle myosin II. I implemented a Bayesian smoothing process over the whole graph, which can be read about more deeply in the matrix and distribution files.
